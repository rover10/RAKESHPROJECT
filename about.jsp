				Now days, shopping through online shopping portals have gained popularity.
				There are many different products available at different shopping portals,
				and with increase in competetion among online shopping portals they provide
				several offers on product, which leads to frequent change in price of products.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td align="justify">
				Hence, we developed this website where we can track the prices of the product
				of our choice. This website simply lets us know the increase or decrease in price
				of the product we mention. We notify our users through e-mail and notification, 
				about the recent change in price of that product.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td align="justify">
				The ability to generate alerts based on price and availability changes is essentially
				the main feature of this website. To track the price of a product, user provide the link
				of product and based on its current price, threshold price is set, at rise or drop in this
				price genrates an alert, assuming the product is also in stock.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td align="justify">
				In this context, alerts can be thought of as log entries, which are delivered via email, 
				containing current price information and useful links (Amazon product
				page, price watch page, etc).
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td align="justify">
				Registration is required to use this functionality, you have to give your name, email address,
				etc. to use this feature. However, guest users will not be able to track the price of the product.
